# IDS-LogFileAnalyzer

A lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Log File Analyzer built in Python. This tool parses and analyzes web server and authentication logs to identify suspicious activities, including brute-force attempts, HTTP errors, and access to sensitive files.

## üìå Features
- Analyze Apache/Nginx access logs
- Detect SSH brute-force attacks
- Identify suspicious file access attempts
- Summary reports with top IPs and HTTP errors
- CSV Alerts generated for further inspection

## üõ† Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Modules: `re`, `csv`, `os`, `collections`


## üöÄ Usage
```bash
python log_analyzer.py
```

## Add your log files

Place your log files inside the logs/ directory.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The logs/ directory is excluded from this Git . Do not upload sensitive logs to GitHub.
